This project is to be a "file data validator".

I want small businesses or individuals to be able to upload a file and for the app to check if the phone numbers are valid or whatever the data type might be that the user wants checked. It could be National insurance numbers, Postcodes, bank sort codes etc. If the data isnt in the right format we'd let them know that it was fixed but if it cant be why it cat be.

I dont want to store anything in a database.

I want to be able to charge money for this service later, after we have it working and well developed.

I want to just get the ability to upload a file and check data then pass it back validated in some simple form in the first instance.

I want to use AI to automate this  as we progress.

I want to use Sveltekit and use the sveltekit latest api and documentation to ensure that our app is stable as possible.

Id like to include testing as early as possoble too.
